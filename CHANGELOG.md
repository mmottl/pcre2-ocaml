# Changelog

## 8.0.4 (2025-02-24)

- change the C code for raising Pcre2.BadPattern to create a short OCaml string,
  not 128-char (so that it won't contain a bunch of garbage at the end).

## 8.0.3 (2025-02-15)

- ugh: forgot to make the function caml_alloc_some (for ocaml [4.08, 4.11]
  support) static. It clashes with the same function from the package `pcre`

## 8.0.2 (2024-12-26)

- Thanks to @nojb, try to get it working for ocaml [4.08, 4.11]

## 8.0.1 (2024-12-20)

- Merged all changes from old `pcre-ocaml`.

- Fixed a bug in the `full_split` function where non-capturing groups were not
  identified as such.

## 7.5.3 (2024-12-23)

- @mmottl fixed bug in `full_split`

## 7.5.2 (2023-09-06)
